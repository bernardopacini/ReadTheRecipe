Easy Garlic Lemon Pork Bites
============================

Details
-------

* Number of servings: 4 
* Cook time: ~30 minutes

Ingredients
-----------
Pork:
* 2lbs boneless pork chop (cut into 3/4 inch cubes)
* ~1 tsp Onion Powder
* ~1 tsp Kosher Salt
* 1 tablespoon Olive Oil

Sauce:
* 1/2 stick butter
* 2 (or let's be honest, 4) cloves of garlic (minced)
* 1 tbsp flour (all purpose)
* 1/2 cup chicken broth
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 1/2 cup parmesan cheese (fresh grated is always best, cause it's gonna melt)
* 1/2 a Lemon juice

Steps
-----

#. Cube Pork into 3/4 inch cubes (consistent size helps with cooking)
#. Place pork in mixing bowl, season with onion powder, salt + pepper
#. In a large skillet (I use 12+ inch) heat olive oil
#. Sear pork for ~3-5 minutes per side, mixing so it cooks evenly. Brown = flavor, so don't be afraid to let it get a bit roasty
#. Remove pork from skillet and set aside, we'll get back to it
#. In same skillet, melt butter, whisk in flour until slightly thickened
#. Add in chicken broth, heavy cream, parmesan cheese, salt + pepper + lemon juice
#. Let simmer for ~7 minutes, we want it to be thicc
#. Add pork bites back in and toss in the Sauce
#. If the sauce is still too thin, add a bit more flour or corn starch to thicken

Notes
-----
* These pork bites are delicious on their own, or served over rice or quinoa.
* Don't be afraid to let things get a little brown. A mustard, caramel color is what you're aiming for.
