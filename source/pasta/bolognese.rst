# Bolognese

## Details
This makes a big batch of sauce. 6 big portions or 8 average ones.
Great to prepare in advance and then heat up later.

## Ingredients
1. 1 lb of 85/15 ground beef. 
2. 1 lb of ground pork.
3. 1.5 cups of dry white wine. Red is fine, too. Just nothing too sweet.
4. 2x 28 oz cans of whole peeled tomatoes.
5. 1 large white onion, diced. Alternatively, two small ones work, too.
6. 2 large cloves of garlic, pressed or minced. 
7. 1/2 lbs of carrots, diced. Adds sweetness.
8. [Optional] 1/3 lbs of celery, diced in the same size as carrots. Adds texture.
9. 1 cup of whole milk.
10. 1 cup of beef stock.
11. Vegetable oil or comparable tasteless oil with a high smoke point.
12. Salt and pepper.
13. Spices of choice: Oregano, nutmeg, smoked paprika, or whatever you like...


## Steps
1. Pre-heat a big pot with a heavy bottom on medium heat for 2 minutes.
2. Add olive oil, diced onions. Stir to coat with oil and salt onions. Cook until they are about to turn translucent.
3. Add diced carrots and celery. Cook for another 2 minutes while stirring frequently.
4. Add meat and break it up as it browns. Add some salt and pepper.
5. While meat is browing, use a blender to blend whole tomatoes. This will speed up the cooking process and make the sauce very fruity. 
6. When the meat lost its red, raw color, add milk and let simmer for a few minutes. This is a great time to add any spices.
7. Add wine and let alcohol simmer away. Then add blended tomatoes and coat all ingredients evenly. 
8. Turn the heat down to medium-low and let simmer for at least 1 hr or until veggies are smooth. Stir occasionally.

Enjoy!

## Notes
Keeps well in fridge or freezer. Better the second time around because flavors melt together over time.
