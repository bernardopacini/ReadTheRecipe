Bolognese
=========

Details
-------

This makes a big batch of sauce.
It is great to prepare in advance and then heat up later.

* Number of servings: 6-8
* Cook time: 2 hours


Ingredients
-----------
* 1 lb 85/15 ground beef
* 1 lb ground pork
* 1 1/2 cup dry white wine. Red is fine, too, just nothing too sweet
* 2 28 oz cans whole peeled tomatoes
* 1 large white onion, diced (two small ones work, too)
* 2 large cloves garlic, pressed or minced
* 1/2 lbs carrots, diced. Adds sweetness
* *(optional)* 1/3 lbs celery, diced in the same size as carrots. Adds texture
* 1 cup whole milk
* 1 cup beef stock
* Vegetable oil or comparable tasteless oil with a high smoke point
* Salt and pepper
* Spices of choice: Oregano, nutmeg, smoked paprika, or whatever you like...


Steps
-----

1. Preheat a big pot with a heavy bottom on medium heat for 2 minutes.
2. Add oil and diced onions. Stir to coat with oil and salt onions. Cook until they are about to turn translucent.
3. Add diced carrots and celery. Cook for another 2 minutes while stirring frequently.
4. Add meat and break it up as it browns. Add some salt and pepper.
5. While meat is browning, use a blender to blend whole tomatoes. This will speed up the cooking process and make the sauce very fruity. 
6. When the meat loses its red, raw color, add milk and simmer for a few minutes. This is a great time to add any spices.
7. Add wine and let alcohol simmer away. Then add blended tomatoes and coat all ingredients evenly. 
8. Turn the heat down to medium-low and let simmer for at least 1 hr or until veggies are smooth. Stir occasionally.

Enjoy!

Notes
-----

Keeps well in fridge or freezer. Better the second time around because flavors melt together over time.
