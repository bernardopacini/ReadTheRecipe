Gnocchi with Brussels Sprouts, Garlic, and a Boat-Load of Butter
================================================================

Details
-------

* Number of servings: 6
* Cook time: 20 minutes

Ingredients
-----------

* 1 lb Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved so they have a big flat face
* 500g gnocchi (or any type of pasta)
* At least 4 cloves of garlic (preferably more), finely minced
* The juice and zest of 1 lemon (zest less important than juice)
* 6 tbsp butter
* Chili flakes
* *(optional)* Parmesan
* *(optional)* 1/2 tsp honey

Steps
-----

#. Bring a large pot of water to boil. Add salt.
#. Coat the bottom of a frying pan with olive oil and add the sprouts flat-side down.
#. Scatter lemon-zest on top, put the heat on medium high. Cover the pan with a lid and cook for 3-5 minutes, until the sprouts are browned and are soft. Remove from pan.
#. Place the gnocchi in the boiling water for 2-3 minutes until they float. Drain.
#. Add the drained gnocchi to the frying pan (you may need to add a little more oil) and cook for 2-3 minutes, until they start to crisp up.
#. Add back in the sprouts, along with the garlic, chili flakes, butter, salt and pepper, cook until the butter starts to brown.
#. Add the lemon juice, honey if using, and a splash of pasta water, stir to combine. Serve with parmesan.

Notes
-----

If using pasta instead of gnocchi, skip the gnocchi browning step (unless you like crispy pasta). You'll probably also want to put the pasta on before you start the sprouts for the timing to work out.
