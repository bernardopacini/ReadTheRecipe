Day 1: The Crust
================

Cookies
-------

#. Combine together in a sifter 3/4 cup flour, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Sift the mixture onto parchment paper and set aside.
#. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade, combine 3 ounces semisweet chocolate, 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, and 1/4 cup light brown sugar. Process for 20 seconds. Add 4 tablespoons butter and 1 egg and process for 10 seconds. Add 2 teaspoons vanilla extract and process for 20 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
#. Add the sifted flour mixture to the chocolate mixture in the food processor, then pulse for 20 seconds.
#. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Portion 12 tablespoons batter, 2 inches apart, onto each of the two baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven for 22 to 25 minutes. Allow the baked cookies to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes.

Crust
-----

#. In a food processor fitted with a metal blade, chop the cookies in two batches. Pulse each batch until all the cookies are in crumbs (this should yield 4 cups crumbs), 10 to 15 seconds.
#. Coat the inside of a 9 by 3-inch springform pan with 1 tablespoon butter.
#. Combine the cookie crumbs with 4 tablespoons melted butter. Mix by hand until the crumbs bind together.
#. Press the crumbs around the buttered sides of the springform pan, then press the crumbs onto the buttered bottom of the pan.
#. Place the pan in the freezer overnight (or at least 15 minutes if you're trying to do this all in one day).

Day 2: The Cheesecake
=====================

#. In the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade, process the raspberries for 10 seconds.
#. Heat 1 inch of water in the bottom half of a double boiler over medium high heat. Place 16 ounces semisweet chocolate, 1/3 cup coffee, and the pureed raspberries in the top half of the double boiler. Heat uncovered for 8 to 10 minutes, then remove from the heat and stir until smooth.
#. Place 1 1/4 pounds softened cream cheese, 1 cup sugar, and 1 teaspoon salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat on low speed for 1 minute, on medium for 1 minute, and on high for 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then beat on high for 2 more minutes. Scrape down the bowl, then beat for 2 additional minutes on high speed.
#. Add the 4 eggs, one at a time, beating on high for 15 seconds and scraping down the bowl after each addition. Then beat for 1 more minute on high.
#. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and beat on high for 5 seconds.
#. Remove the bowl from the mixer. Use a rubber spatula to finish mixing the batter until it is smooth and thoroughly combined.
#. Pour the cheesecake mixture into the prepared springform pan, spreading evenly.
#. Place a baking sheet partially filled with 4 cups hot water on the bottom rack of a 325 degree oven (the bottom rack should be at least 3 inches below the center rack). Place the springform pan on the center rack of the oven. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 225 and bake for 2 hours, until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees.
#. Turn off the oven and allow the cheesecake to remain in the oven for an additional 30 minutes.
#. Remove from the oven and cool at room temperature for 30 minutes.
#. Refrigerate the cheesecake for 12 hours (do not remove the cake from the pan).

Day 3: The Finale
=================

Raspberry Sauce
---------------

#. Puree 1 pint red raspberries with 1/2 cup sugar in a food processor fitted with a metal blade for 12 to 15 seconds.
#. Transfer the sauce to a bowl, cover with film wrap, and refrigerate.

Chocolate Ganache
-----------------

#. Once the cheesecake has chilled for at least 12 hours, heat 1/3 cup heavy cream, 1 tablespoon butter, and 1 tablespoon sugar in a 2 1/2 quart saucepan over medium high heat. Bring to a boil.
#. Place 3 ounces semisweet chocolate in a heat-safe bowl. Pour the boiling cream over the chocolate and allow to stand for 3 to 4 minutes. Stir until smooth.
#. Pour over the top of the chilled cheesecake. Use a rubber spatula to spread the ganache evenly over the top of the cake, being careful not to spread it over the edge and down the sides of the cheesecake.
#. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to set.

The Eating Part
---------------

#. The cheesecake can now be released from the springform pan. Wrap a damp, hot towel around the sides of the pan (the towel should be large enough to completely wrap around and cover the sides of the pan) and hold around the pan for about 1 minutes. Carefully release and remove the springform pan.
#. Optionally, garnish the top of the cheesecake with fresh, whole red raspberries.
#. Use a serrated knife to trim the crust so that it is level with the ganache (trim the crust away from the cake so that it does not fall into the ganache).
#. Portion 3 to 4 tablespoons raspberry sauce onto each plate.
#. Heat the blade of a serrated knife under hot running water before slicing into the cheesecake. Cute the cheesecake with the serrated knife, reheating after making each slice.
#. Place a piece of cheesecake in the center of each sauced plate.
#. Enjoy!
