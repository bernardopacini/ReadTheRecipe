Steps

Tofu Crumbles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. Preheat the oven to 350 and spray a baking sheet with non-stick spray or line with a silicone mat.
#. In a large bowl, mix together the soy sauce, nutritional yeast (or parmesan), chili powder and paprika. It will be pasty. Now crumble the tofu into the bowl with your hands, and mix together until well combined with the paste.
#. Spread the tofu mixture evenly on the baking sheet. Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, stirring the tofu halfway through. Once the tofu is in the oven, start the chili.


Chili
^^^^^
#. In a large pot over medium heat, add the olive oil. Add the chopped onion and saut√© 3-4 minutes until translucent.
#. Add in the garlic and cook 1 more minute, stirring constantly.
#. Add all the rest of the chili ingredients, except the tofu, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for about 20 minutes.
#. Once the tofu crumbles are done, stir them into the pot to complete the chili. Serve hot or refrigerate for later. Keeps for about a week.

Notes
-----
* Serve with (vegan) sour cream, cornbread, tortilla chips, cilantro, hot sauce, (vegan) cheese shreds, or chives, if desired.
