Butternut Squash Soup
=====================

Details
-------

* Number of servings: 6
* Time: 45 minutes

Ingredients
-----------

* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 red onion, chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, chopped
* Kosher salt to taste (roughly 2.5 tsp, 1/4 to 1/2 that amount if using table salt)
* 1 medium butternut squash (about 2.75 lbs), peeled, seeded, and chopped
* 1 sweet potato (about 8 ounces), peeled and chopped
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/4 teaspoon ground coriander
* Ground black pepper to taste
* *(optional)* 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon ground saffron
* *(optional)* Drizzle of maple syrup
* *(optional)* A few drops of orange blossom water
* *(optional)* Sumac for serving

Steps
-----

#. In a large pot, heat the oil over medium heater. Add the onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and a pinch of salt and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the squash, sweet potato, cinnamon, cumin, coriander, 2.5 tsp salt (if using table salt instead of kosher, use much less, probably 1/4 to 1/2 the amount), and 1/4 tsp pepper. Stir to combine and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 5 minutes.
#. Add 3.5 cups water, turn the heat up to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the saffron, if using. Stir to combine, cover, and simmer until the squash and sweet potatoes are soft and cooked through, about 25 minutes. Taste the broth for seasoning.
#. Blend the soup in a blender (or use a hand blender in the pot) until smooth. Give a taste. If you like, drizzle with the tiniest bit of maple syrup and/or orange blossom water, and blitz again to combine. Serve and brighten up each bowl with a sprinkling of sumac.

Notes
-----
Stores and freezes well.
