Welcome to ReadTheRecipe!
As graduate students in computational fields working on optimization, we strive to optimize our day-to-day life!
This cookbook is here to make it easy for you to satisfy those midnight teaching / research / debugging / advising cravings when dinner time has come and gone with no food in sight.
All jokes aside, this cookbook is here to centralize recipes in an easy to search website using the tools computational researchers are familiar with.
We hope you enjoy the recipes we have here and please don't hesitate to contribute to the project!

We'd love to hear your feedback on the recipes (please open an [Issue](https://github.com/bernardopacini/ReadTheRecipe/issues) if you have feedback!) and would love to add recipes contributed by the broader community.
To do so, please make a fork (no pun intended, we're cooking after all) of the repository and submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/bernardopacini/ReadTheRecipe/pulls).
We will make the recipe and taste test it before merging it into the cookbook.
Thanks in advance for any contributions!
