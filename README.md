ReadTheRecipe
=============

Welcome to ReadTheRecipe!
As graduate students in computational fields working on optimization, we strive to optimize our day-to-day life!
This cookbook is here to make it easy for you to satisfy those midnight teaching / research / debugging / advising cravings when dinner time has come and gone with no food in sight.
All jokes aside, this cookbook is here to centralize recipes in an easy to search website using the tools computational researchers are familiar with.
We hope you enjoy the recipes we have here and please don't hesitate to contribute to the project!

To do so, please make a fork (no pun intended, we're cooking after all) of the repository and submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/bernardopacini/ReadTheRecipe/pulls).
